## Day 4 – Securing a Leak and Deprovisioning

### Scenario:
After a confidential contract leak jeopardized negotiations with Chicago, I was tasked with securing the file and deprovisioning the employee responsible for the breach.

### Tech Explanation:
I encrypted the contract file using EFS and restricted access to authorized groups only. I also disabled the terminated employee’s account, removed all group memberships, and revoked access to email and systems. (Consulted ChatGPT for best practices on user deprovisioning and file encryption.)
