## Day 4 â€“ Securing a Leak and Deprovisioning

After a confidential contract leak jeopardized negotiations with Chicago, I was tasked with securing the file and deprovisioning the employee responsible for the breach.

I encrypted the contract file using EFS and restricted access to authorized groups only. I also disabled the terminated employeeâ€™s account, removed all group memberships, and revoked access to email and systems. (Consulted ChatGPT for best practices on user deprovisioning and file encryption.)
