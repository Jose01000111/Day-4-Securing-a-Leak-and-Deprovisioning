## Day 4 â€“ Securing a Leak and Deprovisioning

After a confidential contract leak jeopardized negotiations with Chicago, I was tasked with securing the file and deprovisioning the employee responsible for the breach.

I encrypted the contract file using EFS (Encrypting File System) and restricted access to authorized groups only. I also disabled the terminated employeeâ€™s account (Staley The Bear), removed all group memberships, and revoked access to email and systems. (Consulted ChatGPT for best practices on user deprovisioning and file encryption.)

### ðŸ§ª Lab Tasks

#### 1. Create the Leaked Contracts File
I created a file named leaked_contracts.txt that contained sensitive contract data. To ensure its confidentiality, I stored it in a secure and access-controlled location within the system.

#### 2. Blocked Staley's Azure AD Account: Prevented the user from signing in.
To immediately revoke access, I blocked Staleyâ€™s Azure Active Directory account, preventing future sign-ins. I removed the user from all group memberships to cut off access to any group-based resources. I also revoked all assigned licenses and forced a sign-out from all active sessions across devices. For good measure, I used the gpupdate /force PowerShell command to apply policy changes.

#### 3. Deprovision Staley the Bear's Account
I officially deprovisioned Staleyâ€™s account by disabling it in Azure Active Directory. I ensured the user was removed from all AD groups and performed a final forced sign-out to terminate any lingering sessions or access points

#### 4. Audit and Verify
I reviewed Microsoft Entra logs to confirm that the file was accessed appropriately and that all account changes were successfully logged. For assurance, I consulted ChatGPT to align the process with best practices for deprovisioning and sensitive file handling.
