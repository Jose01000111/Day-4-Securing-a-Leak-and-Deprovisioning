## Day 4 – Securing a Leak and Deprovisioning

After a confidential contract leak jeopardized negotiations with Chicago, I was tasked with securing the file and deprovisioning the employee responsible for the breach.

I encrypted the contract file using EFS (Encrypting File System) and restricted access to authorized groups only. I also disabled the terminated employee’s account (Staley The Bear), removed all group memberships, and revoked access to email and systems. (Consulted ChatGPT for best practices on user deprovisioning and file encryption.)

### 🧪 Lab Tasks

#### 1. Create the Leaked Contracts File
Created a file named leaked_contracts.txt containing sensitive contract data.
